# GameOfLife

In this project i have created a game called GameOfLife. The game is an animation that shows cells getting alive, staying alive and dieing. 
There are 3 rules that determines which fate they will have:

**A dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell**
**A live cell with two or three live neighbours stays alive**
**In all other cases, a cell dies or remains dead**

Yellow cells are live cells.
You can start the animation, stop the animation (pause) and input random cells.
